Systems in the Modern EU – Comfort, Quality, and the Silent Price</h1>
<h2
id="everyday-life-windows-android-and-apple-as-social-standards">Everyday
Life: Windows, Android, and Apple as Social Standards</h2>
<p>In the modern EU, the choice of IT systems is rarely a real choice.
Microsoft Windows and Android have become everyone’s OS – installed in
schools, at universities, and at workplaces. iOS, iPadOS, and macOS
have, in many environments, become the “smart” and socially respected
choices – not least among students, creatives, and decision-makers.</p>
<p>It is stable. It is user-friendly. It works. And precisely because of
this, very few people ask questions.</p>
<p>But behind the comfort lies a structural dilemma, which is not about
doomsday or fear – but about sovereignty.</p>
<h2 id="the-logic-of-comfort">The Logic of Comfort</h2>
<p>Most Europeans have grown up with these systems. From primary school
to university, one learns Windows and Office. The mobile phone is
Android or iPhone. The workplace systems are integrated with American
cloud platforms.</p>
<p>This means that the alternative is not just “another operating
system.” It is perceived as a break with the familiar. A loss of
competence. A social risk.</p>
<p>Technology is not just a tool – it is culture.</p>
<h2 id="sovereignty-without-drama">Sovereignty Without Drama</h2>
<p>The question is not whether Microsoft, Google, or Apple are “evil.”
The question is structural.</p>
<p>These systems are developed for an American market, under American
legislation, with American commercial interests as the starting
point.</p>
<p>The EU has GDPR as a strong legal basis. But when the infrastructure
– operating systems, app ecosystems, cloud integrations – is designed
outside of Europe, an asymmetry arises.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily a breach of the rules. It is a balance of
power.</p>
<h2 id="the-silent-dependence">The Silent Dependence</h2>
<p>The dependence does not show itself in everyday life. It shows itself
in the absence of alternatives.</p>
<p>When the entire education system is built on certain platforms,
competencies and expectations are shaped accordingly. When companies
recruit, knowledge of these systems is expected. When public
institutions procure, they choose what everyone already can.</p>
<p>This creates a self-reinforcing cycle.</p>
<p>Not because anyone wants it that way. But because it is easiest.</p>
<h2 id="existential-resistance-to-new-platforms">Existential Resistance
to New Platforms</h2>
<p>The idea of new, European mobile platforms or desktop environments
often meets resistance. Not because they are technically bad. But
because they break with habit.</p>
<p>For many, it feels like an existential threat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I lose my competencies?</li>
<li>Do I lose compatibility?</li>
<li>Do I lose social affiliation?</li>
</ul>
<p>It is less about technology and more about identity.</p>
<h2 id="a-mature-conversation">A Mature Conversation</h2>
<p>Europe therefore does not face a simple technological choice. It is a
cultural and political choice.</p>
<p>The question is not whether Windows, Android, or Apple should be
banned. The question is whether the EU wants strategic capacity to own
and control its fundamental digital layers itself.</p>
<p>Digital sovereignty does not mean isolation. It means freedom of
choice.</p>
<p>And freedom of choice requires real alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The modern EU is comfortably digital. But comfort and control are not
the same.</p>
<p>If Europe wants long-term technological freedom, it requires
investment in its own ecosystems – even if they seem less polished at
first.</p>
<p>Because technology is not just user experience. It is
infrastructure.</p>
<p>And infrastructure is power.</p>
